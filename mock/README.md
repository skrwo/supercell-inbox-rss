# Mock data
Here we store mocked Supercell Inbox API responses so we can use it to test feeds generation without fetching a real up-to-date data. You can also use it as example responses if you want to directly use the API without our feeds or modify the feed generator.
# Generate mocks
To fetch & save API responses as mock files you should run the following command from the repository root:
```
python -m mock
```
