    <title>Clash Royale League is back!</title>
    <updated>2024-03-07T19:36:24.367000+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;CRL is back with another year of the highest level of competitive Clash Royale! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following last year&amp;#39;s format, this year will bring you top-tier gameplay with Monthly Qualifiers, Golden Tickets, an in-person event, and MORE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ysqNjOgLDXs"&gt;📺 [EMBEDDED VIDEO]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;We are continuing with monthly competitions!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the success the monthly competitions had in 2021 and 2023, there was no way we’d let them out! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in April, the top 1000 players of the Path of Legends will be able to face each other in Monthly Qualifiers until only 8 players remain. The top 8 players will then move to the Monthly Finals, with the winner receiving a Golden Ticket directly to the CRL World Finals!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 5 monthly competitions will be played in-game via the Tournament Hub from April to August. These competitions will award the top players with prize money, hand out Golden Tickets, and distribute CRL competitive points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Golden Tickets, Competitive Points, and MORE!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard your dream is to set foot on the big stage, along with the best of the best, is that right? If so, here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Golden Tickets&lt;/b&gt; - By playing in the PoL and placing in the top 1000, you’ll already increase your chances of winning a Golden Ticket, which will be awarded to the Champion of each Monthly Final. A total of 5 Golden Tickets will be awarded this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competitive Points&lt;/b&gt; - If you don’t reach 1st place, you’ll still earn CRL Competitive Points, which will sum up each month in a leaderboard. The player who places first by the end of August will automatically get the 6th Golden Ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More?&lt;/b&gt; - There are 2 more ways of securing a place at the World Finals. 1 Golden Ticket will be awarded to the champion of the Chinese Tournament, similar to last year. The final Golden Ticket will be awarded to the top player of yet another leaderboard. Wait, one more leaderboard? Yes! This year, 1 spot will be saved for the Community Tournaments. More news on this will be shared soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Check out the full monthly season calendar:&lt;/h1&gt;

    <title>CRL24: Everything you need to know!</title>
    <updated>2024-04-01T04:34:14.340000+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;Another year of the highest level of Clash Royale is right around the corner, and here’s all you need to know to take your shot and become the CRL24 World Champion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A FIVE-MONTH JOURNEY. 8 GOLDEN TICKETS. 1 WORLD CHAMPION.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clash Royale League is more competitive than ever! With five monthly seasons from March until August, you’ll have five chances to win the title of Monthly Champion and a ticket to the CRL24 World Finals. Three more spots will be available through the CRL Leaderboard, the Community Tournaments Leaderboard, and a separate competition within China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From PoL to Monthly Champion, let’s go over how you can get there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;START YOUR CLIMB IN THE PATH OF LEGENDS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The in-game rewards are nice, but let&amp;#39;s move past that! Keep your eyes on that shiny gate, until you reach the prestigious “Ultimate Champion” League. From there, the true climb is ON! Build up your rating and move up the ladder until you see yourself in the Top 1000. If the season ends and your name is listed in there, congratulations, you are in the Monthly Qualifiers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FROM 1000 TO 8: MONTHLY QUALIFIERS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You arrived at the Top 1000 of the Path of Legends, and you see that little icon appear on your main screen. This is the time for you to sign up through the Tournament Hub, which is also where the competition will be played. Put on your best gear and prepare for two intense days of battles in the Royale Arena! Check out how each day will be played:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 1: A 1000-player Swiss Bracket until 32 players remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 2: Players will be placed into one of 8 groups of 4 players each. Each player will play everyone in their group twice. The top player from each group will move on to the next stage and complete our lineup of 8 Monthly Finalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All battles will be played in the Duels format, with players receiving an invite for a single game. Once that game is over, players must edit their deck and accept the invite for the next battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;THE MONTHLY FINAL&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you made it! Welcome to the Monthly Final, where the eight best players from the Monthly Qualifiers will battle it out for the coveted title of Monthly Champion. In this stage, you’ll be placed in a double-elimination bracket, played in the Duels format, lasting 1 Day. Since you are already here, you might as well give it your all! But if you don’t make it to first place, don’t despair, as there are more ways to get your hands on a Golden Ticket!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;WHAT ABOUT THE MONTHLY PRIZE POOL?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reaching the Monthly Final, you will already take home a share of the $50,000 prize pool! Check out how the monthly prizing will be distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://clashroyale.inbox.supercell.com/9jtsgmsiuthj/7zTmNOeHwPYV8PdFzZe9KV/8c222cb80433bbb208d9903908e7ae07/monthly_prizing_twitter.jpg?w=1920&amp;h=1080&amp;f=center&amp;fit=fill"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;GOLDEN TICKETS, COMPETITIVE POINTS, AND COMMUNITY TOURNAMENTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each monthly champion will be awarded a Golden Ticket, meaning they have their place reserved at the World Finals. But you will also be able to earn CRL Competitive Points during the Monthly Qualifiers. Here’s how the points will be distributed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monthly Qualifier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 1 (Swiss): 5 points per win (up to 55)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 2 (Double Round Robin): 5 points per win (up to 30)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monthly Final:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1st place: 100 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2nd place: 80 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3rd place: 65 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4th place: 50 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5th-6th: 40 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;7th-8th: 30 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep playing and earning those points because if you finish Top 1 of the CRL Leaderboard, you guarantee yourself a Golden Ticket, marking your spot at the World Finals! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what is better than one leaderboard? Two leaderboards! This year, you can also get on the CRL World Finals road by playing community tournaments, as there will be a unique Community Leaderboard awarding the player who finishes 1st with a Golden Ticket. The tournament&amp;#39;s awarding points will be announced soon. Until then, check out how the points will be distributed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1st place: 100 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2nd place: 80 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3rd place: 65 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4th place: 50 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5th-6th: 40 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;7th-8th: 30 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;9th-12th: 20 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;13th-16th: 10 points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;SUMMING IT ALL UP&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to review all the ways and steps to win a Golden Ticket!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monthly Seasons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Path of Legends: Finish within the Top 1000 to advance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monthly Qualifiers: Signup in the Tournament Hub &amp;gt; Reach the top 32 of the Swiss Stage &amp;gt; Get 1st place of your group in the Double Round Robin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monthly Final: Win in an 8-player double-elimination bracket&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRL Competitive Leaderboard: Finish 1st place by gathering points in the Monthly Seasons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community Leaderboard: Finish 1st place by gathering points in Community Tournaments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;China tournament: Win the separate China tournament.

These tournaments will happen twice a day, with the exception of Saturdays and CRL days. The top 96 players qualify for the main tournament.

    <updated>2024-05-04T16:39:34.512000+00:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Clash Royale League year is underway, and it’s time we do a deep dive into this year’s CRL Community Tournaments and the CRL Community Points Leaderboard. Let’s get right into it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might already know, there 8 ways to earn a Golden Ticket in #CRL24…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning one of the five CRL Monthly Finals &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being the highest-placing Player on the CRL Points Leaderboard after the conclusion of the August Monthly Final&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning the China Regional Tournament&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And last, but not least, being the highest-placing Player on the CRL Community Points Leaderboard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CRL Community Leaderboard tracks points that players earn in officially sanctioned community-organized tournaments. There will be a total of four community-organized tournaments during the #CRL24 year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragon League by QLASH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calalas cup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LPL Clash Royale World Tour 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GKR 2024 Solo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Let’s learn a bit more about these Community Tournaments…&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dragon League by QLASH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragon League by QLASH is a 5-season competition, running from April through September.

&lt;img src="https://clashroyale.inbox.supercell.com/9jtsgmsiuthj/1hNrcnrDXbjcYiOsRmYr4y/00b3b3da7606f6314e68f8be48b00c70/CRL_-_Community_Tournaments_Points_Leaderboard_2.jpg?w=1920&amp;h=1080&amp;f=center&amp;fit=fill"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;CRL Community Points Leaderboard&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See above for the CRL Community Points Leaderboard. This Leaderboard will be updated after the end of each Tournament (GKR 2024 Solo &amp;amp; Calalas Cup), or after the end of each Tournament’s Season (Dragon League by QLASH &amp;amp; LPL Clash Royale World Tour 2024).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, the final Phase of each of the four CRL Community Tournaments culminates in a 16-player showdown, and the CRL Community Points Leaderboard shows a total of 16 slots. This is because the Top 16 finishers in each Community Tournament will be awarded points towards the CRL Community Leaderboard - the player with the highest placement, and thus, the most Points after the 4 Community Tournaments end, will earn themselves a Golden Ticket and a spot at the #CRL24 World Finals! See the Points breakdown for the Top 16 tournament finishers below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1st Place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;100 Points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2nd Place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;80 Points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3rd Place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;65 Points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4th Place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 Points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5th &amp;amp; 6th Place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;40 Points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;7th &amp;amp; 8th Place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 Points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;9th - 12th Place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 Points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;13th - 16th Place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 Points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if a tie occurs between multiple players on the Community Points Leaderboard after the final Community Tournament ends?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be a total of 3 tiebreakers in the case two or more players have the same amount of Community Points. Check out how the winner of the Golden Ticket will be determined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiebreaker 1: Player with the most total number of Community Tournament wins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiebreaker 2: Player with the most CRL Points (on the CRL Points Leaderboard)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiebreaker 3: Player with the highest average placement in all Path of Legends Race Seasons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can a player win a Golden Ticket via the CRL Community Points Leaderboard if they have already won a Golden Ticket?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. A player can only receive a Golden Ticket via the CRL Community Points Leaderboard if they have not already received a Golden ticket via a Monthly Finals or the CRL Points Leaderboard. If the player with the highest-placement on the Community Points Leaderboard has already received a Golden Ticket, the Golden Ticket will be awarded to the player with the next highest-placement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    <title>CRL24 May Monthly Finals!</title>
    <updated>2024-05-24T15:29:13.287000+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;img src="https://clashroyale.inbox.supercell.com/9jtsgmsiuthj/5o3gfmmpaDFL0w7s0imf3q/79b112c0d24cbbe90ec6f45130f44146/CRL_-_May_MF_Tournament_Article.png?w=1920&amp;h=1080&amp;f=center&amp;fit=fill"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Clash Royale League May Monthly Finals is almost here!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#CRL24 is off to a hot start - in the April Monthly Finals, &lt;a href="javascript:window.sendCommand('OpenWeb?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FMohamedLightCr1')"&gt;Mohamed Light&lt;/a&gt; had an amazing lower bracket run to secure the first Golden Ticket of the year, but we’re just getting started! We still have another seven Golden Tickets to award to the top competitors in competitive Clash Royale, and the road to another #CRL24 Golden Ticket is underway with the May Monthly Finals just around the corner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://clashroyale.inbox.supercell.com/9jtsgmsiuthj/4vBnwFnUnY7MUePZ26Rd8g/4945c3a6f9ada770807804fb7dfd13c0/CRL_-_April_MF_Winner_16x9.png?w=1920&amp;h=1080&amp;f=center&amp;fit=fill"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at the upcoming May Monthly Finals…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Road to the Golden Ticket&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with the May Path of Legends Race - millions of players battled it out for just under one month, climbing the Ladder leaderboard until we found the top 1000. Then came the May Monthly Qualifier - a two-day tournament consisting of a Swiss Stage and a Group Stage, where those top 1000 players competed until only 8 players remained. And now, these 8 players are advancing to the May Monthly Finals, a one-day, double-elimination bracket tournament where everything is on the line. They will fight for the largest-share of the $50,000 prize pool and a shot at a #CRL24 Golden Ticket! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The May Monthly Finals will take place on May 18, starting at 14:00 UTC - mark your calendars and set a reminder, you’re not going to want to miss this!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at this month’s competitors…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://clashroyale.inbox.supercell.com/9jtsgmsiuthj/6kapsIn6K23L2lDm6okSxv/856b7b6ee14558a5ea89285cc12f5a31/CRL_-_May_MF_Starting_Bracket.png?w=1920&amp;h=1080&amp;f=center&amp;fit=fill"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Competitors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the 8 players who will be competing in the May Monthly Finals and show your support to who you want to see be crowned champion!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.sendCommand('OpenWeb?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FMohamedLightCr1')"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mohamed Light&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.sendCommand('OpenWeb?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FFaust_cr')"&gt;&lt;u&gt;SK Faust&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.sendCommand('OpenWeb?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FIan77cr1')"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ian77&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.sendCommand('OpenWeb?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FMutyan_cr')"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mugi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.sendCommand('OpenWeb?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FTaa_0922')"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Taa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.sendCommand('OpenWeb?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FPedrotmcr')"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CAL Pedro&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.sendCommand('OpenWeb?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FCoco_CR04')"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coco&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:window.sendCommand('OpenWeb?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FDOoOM_cr')"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dominik&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Will Ian77 or Mugi claim the Golden Ticket in their second #CRL24 Monthly Finals? Or will the May Monthly Finals Golden Ticket be awarded to another top competitor?
